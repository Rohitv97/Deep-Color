## Before running the application
* You will need the model files for the application to run.
* Here are the trained model files. The models have been trained for 1000 images. 

## Running the application

* Make sure the Tensorflow virtual environment is activated.
* Run the work.py file and Open the URL which shows up on the terminal.
* Make sure the image loaded is 256x256, otherwise the application or the colorizing process won't work. It will crash.
* Once complete you can see the output on the screen. If you need to access the colorized image, you can find it in the static folder of the project.
