## Before running the application
* You will need the model files for the application to run.
* Here are the trained model files. The models have been trained for 1000 images. 
* [Inception-Resnet-v2 Trained Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mM4B6vskiS0N7-qpluWx4ZiASEI2azkA "Click here to download")
* [Xception Trained Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J1N5wpkyl3mg4Z8ygvAtghnTllFkaHIz "Click to download")
* [Model for Colorizing using normal CNN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RsG9kAvKiE4hVyFojUNvyyk1OZST63OO "CNN")
* [Model for Colorizing using CNN and Inception-Resnet-v2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-dc2A2JFshdULB04w0iI-NbunAMKRBHo "CNN + Inception-Resnet-v2")
* [Model for COlorizing using CNN and Xception](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gk7U-iMGASIZ9ZpE9ivVEgUzac6LRRn7 "CNN + Xception")

## Running the application

* Make sure the Tensorflow virtual environment is activated.
* Run the work.py file and Open the URL which shows up on the terminal.
* Make sure the image loaded is 256x256, otherwise the application or the colorizing process won't work. It will crash.
* Once complete you can see the output on the screen. If you need to access the colorized image, you can find it in the static folder of the project.
